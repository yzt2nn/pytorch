# Check 3: Functional implementation correctness check:

# Step 1: Translate args from Python functional to C++ functional
# Step 2: Construct a C++ functional, run forward on it, save its output into a (list of) serialized tensors
# Step 3: Load that serialized tensors into Python, and compare with Python functional output
